# ReactJS
The purpose of this folder is to document my journey of learning React. I have literally no background on this topic. The only resources that I will be using
are YouTube, books and Google. I mean.. they said google is your bestfriend... right? The purpose of learning React is for some challenge which I brought myself 
into despite being tight on time. Can't be helped especially when I have already landed myself into this challenge..

The tools which I will use while learning react is:
Node.js (of course)
VS code
Operating on windows 11 (it'd be cool if I actually done it on a Ubuntu VM but due to time constraint I shall leave this exploration to another day)

Sit back, relax and react to me learning React from scratch.
